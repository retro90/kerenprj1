  <h4>Design Ideas and Process</h4>
  <p>I wasn’t sure how I wanted my website to be because the grid was pretty tricky to use in the html since I have never used in the previous project or in my life. I’m not use to working with the foundation grid so it was difficult for me. It took a lot of tries for the rows to work because it was getting squeeze together when I put the text in the rows. I had to keep trying with the rows and columns. I had to look at lab 5 to see how the rows and columns work. For my design ideas and process, I didn’t use my style tile because it was hard to create through writing and it did not help me so I end up thinking and had used my visual to see how I want the navigation etc to be. I wanted to match it with the title because death for example, when I researched the color wheels, the colors I chose red, purple, yellow, and gray is part of death which gave me a definition of what the color means. The colors gave me an idea of how I want my web page to look like. At first I was going to use black as my text but then, when I looked at the preview, it was hard to see, so I decided to use yellow. I also found images that relates to the story, title and some of the words in the paragraph. Since the requirements was to put the links on the bottom of the page, I had to use lab 5 examples of the 12th small rows to make the links across work, which it did. Playing with the rows and getting used to it, made me understand how I want the navigation, title, and footer to be. I wanted to be creative and put more things to the website but because of time consuming I did not want to. I did not find a background for the website instead I just used a background color to not make it look plain. The process of the webpage came out okay. I think I could have done it better with the designing process so I didn’t have to worry about how it was going to come out. If I had everything planned out on a style tile I think I would have more time working on the website.</p>
